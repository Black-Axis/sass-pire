```

## Usage

After installing `sass-pire` using your favorite package manager, you can import it into any SCSS file.

### Recommended Approach
```scss
@use "sass-pire" as *;
```

### Configure Load Path
Make sure to add the `--load-path=node_modules` flag in your `sass` command in `package.json`:
```json
"scripts": {
  "watch:sass": "sass --load-path=node_modules --watch ./src/index.scss"
}
```

### Deprecation Notice
The `@import` statement will be deprecated in future versions of `Sass`. We strongly recommend using the `@use` statement instead.
